\chapter{Paladins of Something}

\section{Legendary paladins}\label{sec:legendary-paladins}

The world is full of legendary people.
The Order is itself a legendary order,
producing the world's greatest paladins.
The Order no longer exists although some
certainly claim it as their own.
The membership has grown enough that
something of an order does exist.
Or something like that.
Needs some more work.

\subsection{Alkbam}
Known as the bane of the undead,
Alkbam is almost certainly half legend
and half real.

\subsection{Anselm}
Originally from Timiro,
he is popular among healers of all variety
(not just paladins).
He is known to have lived during the time of So and So
but no other biographical information about him has been
uncovered besides a few obscure references to his name.
There are several documents which have been uncovered
that claim to be written by people who either knew him
or knew of him quite well.
These documents are entirely fictional as far as anyone
knows.

\subsection{Eve Silverspun}
An elven paladin.

\subsection{Tabar}
Tabar is believed to be a dimensional traveler.
He is often depicted as angelic---he often has
a large set of feathered wings and a glow about
his head in art works.
As an immortal, Tabar is said by some paladins
to still roam the megaverse doing works of
justice and mercy.
